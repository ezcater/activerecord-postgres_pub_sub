[doc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-notify.html).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "activerecord-postgres_pub_sub"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install activerecord-postgres_pub_sub

## Usage

### Listener

The `Listener` class is used to handle notification messages.

The listener can be configured with three blocks:

* **on_notify**: called whenever a notification is received.
* **on_start**: called before receiving any notifications.
* **on_timeout**: called based on a configurable timeout, when no notifications
  have been received.
  
When creating a listener, the following configuration is supported:

* **listen_timeout**: If set, the `on_timeout` block will be called if 
  no notifications are received within this period. (Default `nil`).  
* **notify_only**: A payload string can be included in notifications. By default
  the listener ignores the payload and coalesces multiple notifications into a 
  single call. When this option is `false`, the `on_notify` block is called with
  the payload for each notification. (Default `true`).
* **exclusive_lock**: Acquire a lock using
  [with_advisory_lock](https://github.com/ClosureTree/with_advisory_lock) prior to listening.
  This option ensures that a process as a singleton listener. (Default `true`).

Example:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::PostgresPubSub::Listener.listen("notify_channel", listen_timeout: 30) do |listener|
  listener.on_start do
    # when starting assume we missed something and perform regular activity 
    handle_notification
  end
  
  listener.on_notify do
    handle_notification
  end
  
  listener.on_timeout do
    perform_regular_maintenance 
  end
end
```

### Generator

This gem contains a Rails generator for a migration to add a trigger to notify on insert to a table.

The generator must be run with a model name corresponding to the table.

```bash
rails generate active_record:postgres_pub_sub:notify_on_insert --model_name NameSpace::Entity
```

In this example, notification events would be generated for the channel named `"name_space_entity"` based
on inserts to the `name_space_entities` table.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
